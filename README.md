**Movie Downloader GUI using Python**

**Description:**

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for searching and downloading movies from a website. It utilizes the following libraries:

- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.
- `bs4` (Beautiful Soup): For parsing HTML and extracting information.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the website.
- `webbrowser`: For opening download links in the default web browser.
- `tkinter`: For building the GUI components.

The program allows users to:

1. Enter a movie name.
2. Click the "Search" button to find the movie on a specified website.
3. View a list of search results in a scrollable listbox.
4. Click on a movie title to retrieve download links.
5. Select a download link from a list of available qualities.
6. Click the "Download Movie" button to open the selected link in the default browser.

The GUI is designed with a clean and user-friendly layout, including appropriate labels, entry fields, buttons, and listboxes.

**Usage:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4. Enter the movie name and follow the on-screen instructions.

**Converting to Executable:**

The Python script has been converted into an executable using PyInstaller. The executable file is located in the "dist" folder within this repository. This allows users to run the program without the need for a Python interpreter or additional dependencies.
